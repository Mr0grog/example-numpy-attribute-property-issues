# Numpydoc Attributes and Properties Issues

This is a minimal example of some issues around attributes that are properties in Numpydoc. To set up, create a virtual environment and then install via pip:

```sh
$ pip install -e .
```

Then build the docs:

```sh
$ sphinx-build docs/source docs/build/html
```
